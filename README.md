## Caravan Workers:
### Alberich Dawnhammer
![Alberic Dawnhammer][images/al.jpg]
>**Name:** Alberich Dawnhammer  
**Nickname(s):** "Al"  
**Race:** Dwarf (Hill)  
**Job:** Drover  
**Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Athletics  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Brewer's Supplies, Dulcimers  
**Description:** Al is a Dwarf of middle age. Somewhere in his second century. Even he's forgotten exactly what his age is. Al's got a rather rough exterior. Full beard, rather unkempt, with bits and pieces of food and old debris. The smell no longer bothers him after all his time behind horses. If he can smell anything at all!  He's got a rather gruff, tough, outward appearance and demeanor, however he's truly got a heart of gold. He's loyal to those around him, and those in the caravan. Thought not naive, he's quick to believe a proven member of the caravan, oftentimes giving them benefit of the doubt. Al's neutral towards animals. They're tools to be used in the trade. However, his grandfather, a smith, always taught him that "Well kept tools can serve you a lifetime".  He looks after and cares for the health and sustainability of the animals and is likely not to push forward through the night, or into unknown territory if there's a chance of exhaustion. Al left his home for a bit of sightseeing.  While the hills and mountains were wonderful, he'd spent over 100 years in them. There was nothing more they could offer him that he hadn't seen. His mandatory military experience completed, and he felt the need to explore. The caravan was honestly only a choice do to it's appropriate timing and convenience.  
**Relationship**: Al enjoys the company of Finn, though mostly for the amusement of having a fellow smaller than he is within this caravan.  Finn gained Al's trust early on within the caravan route by speaking with the horses once they were spooked. Al couldn't calm them, and their full-out sprint nearly caused a collision with another wagon. Though Finn never spoke a word to the animals (he used telepathy), Al believes that Finn has as strong of a connection to the animals as he does himself.  

### Silifrey Evercrown
![Silifrey Evercrown][images/frey.jpg]
>**Name:** Silifrey Evercrown  
**Nickname(s):** "Sil" or "Frey"  
**Race:** Human  
**Job:** Animal Tender  
**Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Medicine  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Herbalism Kit, Alchemist Supplies  
**Description:** Frey is a younger-middle aged woman in her late 30s, early 40s. Dark brown hair with hints of gray beginning to shine through. Hazel colored eyes, and a mild-bronze complexion.  Freckles adorn her face and arms. A small pair of round glasses sit upon the bridge of her nose. Frey tends to the animals on a daily basis. By and large her job revolves around feeding, cleaning, watering, and caring to the animal's medical needs. She's a quiet, mild-tempered woman who spends the majority of her time contemplating something, staring off into the distance, or holding long, one-sided conversations with the animals. She's friendly enough to the rest of the caravan crew, but is an introvert by nature.  They don't however know her secret, and the reason for her contemplation. She used to be a medical doctor in Port Hval. A sweeping sickness hit some in Hval, over a decade ago.  She was on the front lines of tending to the sick. Many of them made it, but there were still losses. Among them were here husband, and young son, only 5 or 6 years old at the time. She wanted **out** of Port Hval, and out of the profession.  The opportunity of the caravan swept her away. She lied, informing Steadyhand that she was a veterinarian of sorts. Over the years though, she's become quite well-equipped to handle most of the caravan's medical needs. Both animal and human.  
**Relationship:** As is his nature, Finn greeting Frey with open arms and a smile.  Rather odd, to Frey, but she allowed it to happen out of politeness.  Over time, she grew to see Finn as a surrogate son of sorts. She's still quiet, and reserved, but she has gone out of her way to show Finn some of the tricks of her trade. Bringing him in to tend to horses and calm them when they do require medical attention. She hasn't revealed why she's taken to him, though the resemblance, with brown hair, green eyes, and freckles, is a large part of it.  

### Gimble Nackle
![Gimble Nackle][images/gimble.jpg]
>**Name:** Gimble Nackle  
**Nickname(s):** "Gim"  
**Race:** Gnome (Rock)  
**Job:** Trader  
**Proficiencies:** Persuasion, Deception  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Jeweler's Tools, Forgery Kit  
**Description:** Gimble is a master of negotiation... or at least getting a profitable outcome for the Caravan, and therefore himself. He's a crude businessman, and will often refuse to budge on price. He's particularly fond of gold and silvered jewelry. He'll inspect a piece for trade, for well over 15 minutes, "Hmmm"ing and grumbling to himself before often times making a rather low-ball offer.  For some reason, it typically works.  He's an asset to the caravan, typically bringing the total profits up by a hefty percentage. The others aren't 100% certain, but they believe that Gimble may have worked out a deal for a slightly larger cut from Steadyhand.  They're often seen continuing to chat after the weekly allowance has been dolled out. He's even set up a portion of a wagon just to himself. His own little "cave of treasures", so to speak. No one else is allowed in unless you're doing business. Many question his business ethics, but rarely call him on it due to his status.  
**Relationship:** Finn is unsure of Gimble. Or, "That's Mr. Gimble to you, flat-foot", as he would say. Gimble is still a mystery to Finn, and their paths don't cross often.  Gimble's got his job, and Finn's got his. The aggressive nature and arrogant tone of Gimble tends to keep him to his own business.  

### Radovhas
![Radovhas][images/vhas.jpg]
>**Name:** Radovhas  
**Nickname(s):** "Rad" or "Vhas"  
**Race:** Centaur  
**Job:** Wagon Repair  
**Proficiencies:** Investigation, Sleight of Hand  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Carpentery Tools, Tinkerer / Smith's Tools  
**Description:** Vhas is a giant among the caravan. He stands a solid six feet, ten inches tall. Vhas's size and bulk typically allows him to work on wagons with relative ease, lifting portions of them to replace wheels, or bending axles back into suitable formation. He's well-established at the creation of new things as well. Many of the boxes and chests that hold trade goods were created by Vhas. His reasons for joining the caravan as still a bit shrouded. He doesn't speak much of his clan, and typically doesn't do the negotiations with other centaurs if trade is to occur.  He's stalwart and emotionless on the outside. His low, booming, voice and sheer size are deterrent enough for most. Never mean, or rude, just blunt and matter-of-factly.  
**Relationship:** Finn and Vhas are friendly enough.  Though there's no true relationship there.  Finn believes Vhas is more interesting simply because of **what** he is and where he comes from. He's attempted to extract information and write it down several times, but Vhas never budges on the subject of his clan. Mostly though, Finn just attempts to stay out of Vhas' way, so he isn't stepped on.  They do get an occasional laugh, smirk, or smile though if Finn or Vhas speak a curse or smart-ass remark in Sylvan. Not many others, if any, on the caravan understand Sylvan.  

### Distant Rain Cloud
![Rain][images/rain.jpg]
>**Name:** Distant Rain Cloud  
**Nickname(s):** "Rain"  
**Race:** Tabaxi  
**Job:** Forager / Hunter  
**Proficiencies:** Nature, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Cooking Utensils, Leather Working Tools  
**Description:** Rain is a lithe built tabaxi. Furs of mostly gray, with patches of white.  He often wears full-covering garb, as he's grown accustomed to it from his home in the desert. He's often times joyous and easy going.  However, he's a natural predator, and becomes Stoic when in "hunting mode".  He's exceptionally quick, learning to run across the dunes of the desert.  The hard ground of the forests and fields often prove no issue for Rain. Rain is training with bows, and smaller weapons, though he mostly prefers to hunt with his own claws. He joined the caravan mostly out of curiosity. All of the different people with the caravan and the number of things they had, that he'd never seen.  They interested him, and his skills suited a need. He's no master chef, but he's able to properly field strip his kills and cook them to an edible fashion.  Believe that no part of a hunt should go to waste, he's begun making small satchels and watering canteens from their hides. Mostly just pieces for the caravan members, but a few have been well-made enough to catch the eye of traders, fetching him an extra coin or two.  
**Relationship:** Rain's jovial nature meshes well with Finn's. Their philosophies align in only hunting for food, and never for fun. So they've gotten on quite well. They have a relationship almost of a pair of brothers.  Rain's taken to teaching Finn some of his leather working, and how to properly dress a kill. The only minor point of contention is Rain's curiosity and internal instinct to bat around small prey.  Finn often has to hide his pet mouse Luch (pronounced Lock) when speaking with Rain. Though, Rain's mostly able to behave himself.
