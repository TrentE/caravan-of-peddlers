# Dwarves
## Deep lake - Loch Domhainn
One of the three dwarven strongholds in Tanriszdir. After the fall of Crùnàrd, the capital of the once great Dwarven Empire, at the hands of Demonic orcs under the control of Grumish the Dwarves retreated farther west across the Grey peaks till they hit the edge of the mountain range. There the remaining clansmen dug into the foothills till breaking into an natural cavern with a underground water way. As time went on Rock Gnomes from the nearby hills and caves joined the dwarves and lived amongst them, helping build infrastructure and the elevators that move the dwarves up and down the waterfall. With the mind of the Gnomes and the craftsmanship of the dwarves a city was carved out and time moved forward into the godless age

Guns on page 268 DMG

### Social
The Dwarves and Gnomes of Loch Domhainn spend much of the little free time they get among family and clansmen, either at home or at the taphouses. If the family is interested on a night on the town can food stands selling dwarven delicaties, Gnomish troupe of actors using fireworks and mechanical toys to make shows, and the fight clubs to watch one on one man matches, with champions of the different clans fighting each other barefisted to the cheering of crowds and being treated as celebrities out of the pit.

The Higher water way, the water leading to and just before the waterfall, is the home to the rich, Gnomish elders, and heads of the Clans. Beautiful stone homes inlaid with bronze and gold, Stone gardens both open to the public and private, and the most luxurious of taphouses serving the best drinks.

The passages through out and around the waterfall are home to the forges, smelters, workshops, and mine. Slag is pushed sent into the water to be washed away and the supply of water helps to cool the forges. The main passageway to the surface is also found here, goods for trade being taken up to to the open Ore market or taken onto the Elevators to be traded among the citizens.

The Lower waterway is the area around the waterfall and lake, this is were most of the dwarves live. Homes and walkways are carved into the stone surrounding it. Markets can be found selling home goods and food to its residents. Boats can be found in the water catching fish for both selling and entertainment, with yearly competitions to see who catches the largest fish. The water flows out from the lake to another waterfall that falls into the abyss of the underdark.

### Political
When the Dwarves were whole in the time before the Gods died they were ruled by the Five Great Clans:

Grey-axe
Copper-Fist
IronHelm
Wyrmhammer
Strong-Spear

These Clans collectively ruled over the entire Western Mountain Ridge, with the other 4 Clans deferring to the rule of the Grey-Axe as High Kings and Queens of the Dwarves. After the Fall of Crùnàrd the Grey-axe were wiped out defending the other retreating clans that would later found Loch Domhainn. In hope of that The Grey-Axes would one day return and take their rightful place as the Monarchs of the Dwarven Strongholds, and if not one of the remaining four houses would claim rulership. Thousands of years have passed since that point, blood lines have mixed to the extent that it is hard to tell who is Originally from what clan. The Dwarves are currently Ruled by the Lord Steward as is tradition when the rightful king is absent, though the Clans are split on what should be done.

The Copper-Fist and Strong-Spear Believe that with the mixing of bloodlines it would be a dangerous risk to let one from an unproven family rule over the dwarves, taking them into directions that might not be for the best for the people. These concerns along with the long standing traditions of the Dwarves, leaves them concerned with the notion of crowning a new ruler

The IronHelm and Wrymhammer however believe that it is time to move forward and reclaim the Dwarves old Glory, the Old bloodlines are Diluted and spread throughout the population, meaning any worthy and capable of leadership could take the throne and lead the people back into their golden days. Loch Domhainn isnt enough to keep the Dwarven people prospering forever, and much of tradition ties their hands unless a new king or queen is appointed.
The Gnomes that joined the Dwarves care little for their worries for a new King, busying themselves with the process of improving Loch Domhainn. The Gnomes while considered members of the city have little political power themselves. The gnomes leave politics to their council of elders, a group of 10 gnomes that are respected among the community, the Elders talk with the the dwarves about the needs of the Gnomes when it arises. The elders don't currently back any one clan or ideal about what should be done about the kingship, believing that having one Dwarf making all the decision for the rest isnt the best idea.
The day to day political life of the common folk is fairly unobtrusive. Taxes are paid to the Head of their clans who than give a percent of that tax money to the crown, were it sits in till the throne is claimed again. Sheriffs appointed by the clan heads, often from the military, guard the streets with groups of guardsmen that keep the peace.

### Economy
As is expected, Metal and gems are in abundance and are the main source of trade along with exports of Dwarven Whiskey. Food goods that are produced locally are used by the population and include root vegetables and tubers, cave mushrooms, oats used for both whisky and bread, as well as meat and milk from herds of goats (Cashmere goats that also provide wool for clothing)  that graze the hills outside the entrance to the city

The Gnomes often trade small trinkets like music boxes and toys as well, bringing in money from travelers looking for curiosities and children with a few coppers to spare.

The Dwarves mostly trade for textiles, Cottons and leathers, Lumber, and food goods that aren't as easily found in the mountains like fresh vegetables and fruits.

The rich are often the most “pure blooded” of the clans that have political power, running mining and farming operations that keep the city running as well as having high ranks in the military. The common folk are the work force and doing the labor that keep goods flowing.

### Religion
With the fall of the gods Religion was pushed to the wayside. Temples are not often found well kept anywhere in the world. The closet to an god that the dwarves have is the hero worship of Yatec Grey-Axe, the Last Dwarven King that held back the waves of hell-orcs(Tanarukk) as the Dwarven clans retreated. His statue can be found in the center square of the higher water way. Most Dwarves know that without his and his men’s sacrifice the Dwarves would not be were they are today.

### Military
The dwarves have a standing military that guard the city and settlements nearby (currently small affairs, that are mostly human population, as time goes on more dwarves will come in and build infrastructure, it will become an proper part of the new dwarven kingdom, but thats for a later date)

The Military is heavily armed and armored thanks to the large amount of raw materials. Most have Plate armor and the training to use it, hammers and shields are the common weapon used to keep the peace in the city. The Dwarves are still considered to be in an semi-state of martial law until the king returns, with all dwarves being required to spend an hundred years of service in the military once they have come of age, those that spend their time are free to go back to civilian life, or to stay with the military and gain rank and respect amongst the dwarves.

Those that don't patrol the the city streets can be found out in the mountain hills and forests patrolling the area around the city. These Dwarven Rifleman move light with breastplates as armor and equipped with rifles and short swords. Their jobs are to be scouts and to firefight smaller groups of enemies that are causing trouble.

The Gnomes don't really fight, their main contribution to military efforts is the production of guns and blackpowder. Black powder is a closely guarded secret of the Gnomes that not even most Dwarves know how to make, its uses by the riflemen help give them a edge in defending their territory. 

The Only major fortress the Dwarves have is the Drop. a compound at the end of the river that falls into the abyss. Though nothing has been seen from the underdark in centuries, the Dwarves haven't forgotten the horrors that can creep up from it.

# Elves
## Schwarzwald - The Black Forest
Before World Crux the world thrives and the Elves thrived with it. The elven kingdom was vast with conclaves found throughout the forests of the world. The Elves were respected as leaders and patrons of the arts and many were seen in the courts of lords and the theaters of high society. 

Then the Gods and Devils went to war and the world burned for it, the Elves found themselves drastically reduced in numbers as all their Conclaves were burn to the ground and the elves living there slaughtered by the minions of gods that had had long standing hatred for the Elves and their gods. Desperate to keep themselves safe a mass order went out to any Elves still alive to return to the Heart of the Elves power, Schwarzwald. After months of fear and terror and a desperate drive to the once grand homeland of the favored children of the gods  less than a tenth of the elves in the world manage to return to their home before magic was used to seal it away behind a thick wall of fog and disoriating Miasma that creeped through the forest. Despite their massive losses the Elves of Schwarzwald were overcrowded, afraid and desperate as many felt the once great woods were to become one mass grave. 

As the leaders of Schwarzwald argued over what actions should be taken and how to best care for their people a voice sweet and calming washed over then as it hummed out pleasantries and promises of protection if they would do one thing for it, Obey.

Desperate, surrounded by the cries of other elves, now Godless as the war drew closer to its end, and strangely soothed by the song this voice sang the elves agreed to Service in exchange for protection. The voice, that later it was to be discovered that it was the dragon Nimina, kept its word, no trouble bothered the elves as they rebuilt society and planned for their future. Nimina had kept her word, now the elves were honor bound to keep theirs.
### Social
Elves have always been patrons of the arts, painters, actors, and musicians can be found everywhere across Schwarzwald. Theaters play out plays and musicals that are found nowhere else in the world anymore, massive libraries hold more books than the rest of the world does combined, and statues and paintings fill every house and public building.

The hunt is also an very important aspect of society, boarding on near religious importance. All Elves are taught to hunt from an young age from tracking to cleaning the kill but it is primarily the woman that hunt. Events are held every century to hunt the most impressive game (thought these events have evolved from a test of hunting prowess to an gift giving to Nimina) winners of this competition are given great honor among the elves and are named the mistress of the hunt till the next one
Families are not naturally tight knit like other, Elven children when born are raised by their parents and the other elves that live nearby, with so many having perished in the time of world Crux new generations are considered important. They are trained to defend themselves and taught the history of the elves so as not to forget were they came from and what they live for. (this usually includes instilling in them a certain sense of superiority in them, Elves act as they are the only really civilised people left in the world after the other great civilisations fell in the war and that keep things orderly and in the same way as they were is the only way to keep the elves from devolving into savages like those outside the forest) 

Schwarzwald has more living there besides just elves though elves sit comfortably on top of the social food chain, Forest Gnomes and Firblogs can also be found living there. Gnomes are often found in elven homes as servants,Butlers or maids, not slaves but treatment of them very from house to house, some treated like family members or close friends other as barely acknowledge help. Firbolgs are grounds keepers and laborers that keep the city and woods upkept. With their closer connection to the fae Firblogs are more respected by the Elves than the gnomes, being Druids and shock troopers in society are another option for Firblogs.

### Political
The day to day life of the elves is ran by a Oligarchy of Elves that are they themselves ruled by the Green Dragon Nimina, many of them thousands of years old and remembering the days following Worlds Crux. this living through hard times and the tragedies that happened to the Elves have lead to Isolation being agreed upon as the best way to keep the Elves safe. Very very few elves ever leave the Black Forest and even fewer come back.

Numbers and records are kept on all elves that leave Schwarzwald for any reason and they are intensely questioned as dispelling magic is cast on them to remove charm effects and to reveal any shape changers if they do return while also detaining any that manage to come with them.

While the Elves are the face of the government, Nimina holds the true power, secret police made of the most loyal of elves and the Green Dragonborn that worship her take out dissenters were ever they spout, green kolbolds trained in illusion magic stalk through the city and whisper information back to the green Dragon herself. Musicians that catch Nimina’s fancy are taken as trophies to play their melodies to her, and those that are born with innate power in them are collected at an young age and trained and conditioned to be loyal to Nimina above all. Loyalty is all that matters to the Dragon as she weaves her plans to take over more from inside the hemlock grove.

### Economy
The Black forest is self sustaining without any outside trade. Fruits and vegetables grown aplenty with the touch of magic from the druids, the sea elves that live on the coastal edge of the forest bring in various seafood, and hunters go out and gather enough meat to satisfy Niminia as well as to provide meat to the higher class. Leathers and cottons provide materials for clothing and other goods. Wines are made out of various fruits and are used at both social gatherings and events

The lack of metals however have lead to an interesting use of wood for armor and weaponry, wood is carved (or in the case of very special items, grown to the exact shape desired) into armor or weapon and are then heavily enchanted to be as effective as steel in combat, Elven blacksmiths are more carpenters and powerful enchanters than they are melder of metals.

### Religion
Though the rest of the world lacks much faith in anything the elves still have things they believe in.

First and foremost in Nimina, she is seen as a savior of the elves and is treated as such. She is given tribute from every successful hunt and it is considered an honor by many to be chosen by her, either as an agent or as a musician. (while publicly she is loved the green dragon is not a saint. Those few that do not agree with her are quietly taken away and dealt with as she makes a carefully crafted image of an hero)

The other entity of importance in the Black forest is at its center, the great tree Laubfall. This tall and magnificent tree is said to be tied to every elf in Tanrisizdir. A new green leaf grows for every elf born, and when an elf dies a leaf falls to the ground where it is tradition to take the leaf and bury it with the elf in question. During the events of Worlds Crux when many elves died, many leaves fell burying the area around the tree in a event now known as the Withering {think of another name}

Druids are the spiritual leaders of the elves. Serving to construct funeral rights for the deceased, keeping the forest healthy, and food plentiful. Over the years many druids have succumb to the darker more primal sources of power thanks to the influence of Nimina.

### Military
When all elves come to age the are trained in how to fight and how to defend themselves. After some time spent training and on some missions in the Forest, the elves are let back into society as an cavillian, ready to be called on at a moments notice. At any one time only a few elves or on duty to protect the city from interlopers and animals that wonder to close to the city.

The Head of the elven army is the Lord of blades, particularly male and considered the counter part of the hunt mistress the Lord of blades spends lifetimes perfecting every style of martial prowess known to the elves from stealth, fighting, hand to hand combat, and magic of various types. The Lord of blades is often the oldest trained elf, patient and capable of strategy and using the few resources the elves have to maximum efficiency.

## Port Hval
When the Gods died in their war the world suffered for it. Entire kingdoms were folded into the earth as it crumbled, flames both holy and profane burned across the world devouring all enemies in their path, And angels and devils fought across the mortal plane, dragging any nearby into the carnage. In this time empires, king, queens, and all forms of order crumbled. The people that survived this war after the gods and archdevils wiped each other out were left in a world in ruins and did what they could to survive. Many became nomadic, going from place to place to find what resources they could and to escape from the monsters that had started taking over the world in the absence of those that could fight them. Few settled down, those that did did so do due to finding a source of food and safety. Such was the case with the nomads that formed the soon to be Port Hval.
The waters were shockingly untouched during the war of heavens, the gods that call the ocean their domain did well in protecting it before their demise wildlife teemed in the oceans, pearls sparkled in the water, kelp and seaweed grew in thick underwater forests, and almost all of it was out of reach of those who dwelled on the land, Tritons, Sahuagin, and Merrow dwelled in the depths and don't take kindly to their pristine realm being trespassed on by those who kingdoms and lands were nothing but ash, few had managed to etch out a life by the sea until a discovery was made, a natural bay were Whales came year round to meet and rear young. There was an opportunity in these pods as the water was shallow enough for the sea faring races to not take interest in it but deep enough for boats to sail. Over the centuries techniques were made to hunt and drag whales to land, docks were made for boats and slaughter yards for the bodies of whales. Houses sprung up and farms began to weave through the land around the bay as the land became more capable of cultivation. And in a time, Port Hval was born, a city of seamen and hunters, farmers and traders, and maybe one day Gods and kings

### Social
Port Hval is a place filled with people from across the continent coming and going. Trade canavan's selling goods are common, the culture of the port is a blend of nearly every race coming together from across the world (Depending on the wins/loses and decisions of the players certain groups can gain more or less power leading to a more obvious presence of that races culture) the one thing that ties them all together is the need of sailors and Flensers for when whales are brought into the harbor.

The hunting of whales is a major staple of Port Hval’s day to day life, Every year during whaling season hundreds of whales are brought in and butchered for food and supplies. 

Sailors are extremely common fair in Port Hval as well, with nearly half the population having some knowledge on how to handle a boat and catch a fish, next you will fine the merchants and the trader nomads that come and go from Hval as they please, bringing in goods that can't be found normally. Anyone else in the town begins to fill in the spots needed for tailors, blacksmiths, shipwrights, etc.

Free time is often spent at taverns, drinking away cares or playing away coins in games of cards, competitions among the whalers have formed to see who can catch the biggest sea  beast and haul it into port, some enjoy their time amongst the trade caravans, never able to leave Hval but loving every story they can hear about the lands around them.

### Political
With its need for sailors and boats to keep Port Hval functional power goes to the one with the largest fleet of boats. The 5 largest fleets form the Admiralty Council that run the city as a whole 

 These “admirals” run the large scale operations that keep the city fed and functioning, building new homes for their men and their families while also building new ships to add to their influence. With the nature of how power is gained in the port, the power base can flux wildly with events like natural storm, pirate and seafolk raids, and even sabotage from rivals can cause an admiral to fall from grace and lose their position of power. As such many Admirals are paranoid of corruption in their ranks and will act swiftly and mercilessly to cull any threats to their power.

### Economy
Whales are at the center of the economy in lots of ways, meat is butchered and spread out amongst the town’s people for personal and commercial use, blubber is melted down into oil to be used for a variety of purposes from lamp oil to soup, Bones are stripped clean of all flesh and than the largest pieces like the ribs and spinal columns are used to reinforce or even replace lumber while building homes and other buildings. 
Fishing, crabbing, and clam digging  come next, those that own their own boat can make a semi comfortable life selling seafood and the occasional bouts of pearls. Those who don't own their own ship can often find work on one of the many boats owned by the Admirals or other smaller fleets, though duty on an Admiral’s ships means you are expected to take on extra duties for the sake of the port.

The farms outside the city, though small, do provide some fruits and vegetables for use in the town as well as some left over to be traded, grain is turned into bread and beer, and the sparse woods near the coast provide enough lumber for the time being.

The Port takes in mostly goods like metal and textiles like wool, Metals are most often brought in from trade caravans that travel to the lands of the dwarves and hobgoblins while wools are often bought of those that roam with a flock of sheep when they come near the port

### Religion
As with most places in the world, Gods and worship are not a common part of the cities day to day, but sailors have always been a superstitious lot, small talismans and rituals are often done to keep the men and the boats safe, from thanking the sea for the fish caught, to throwing back and personal items caught in a net, or even rushing back to port at full speed if a song is heard on the sea breeze.

### Military
The ports main power comes from its fleets, many of the fishing boats double as transportation for men to where they are needed along the coast quickly. Sailors that are under the command of the admirals are also the ports Guards and militia, expected to keep the peace and to watch out for any attempts to sabotage their employers position.

Most of the Sailors have light armor and short swords and daggers, the kind of weapons and armor that work just as well on a boat on the sea as they do in the streets of the port.

The Walls around the city are mostly wood reinforced with stone and whale bone, they are functional for the time being to keep out minor threats, but against a proper invasion they might not hold
 
# Hobgoblin
## Egchiin-ger
Far to the north, past the grey mountains were the dwarves and the Dragon Belroc reside  there are three lakes, and in the valley nestled between those three lakes lies Egchiin-ger, the center of the Hobgoblin’s power and their home.

When the Hobgoblin’s god Maglubiyet died with the rest of the gods, the Hobgoblins were lost. Their whole purpose in life was to fight, die and be brought back in their gods army to fight again. Without that goal to drive them and no god to please they began to wonder, searching for a purpose, something worth fighting for, after years of wondering their lives became more and more nomadic until finally settling down next to the lakes.
### Social
Though Maglubiyet is gone, the Hobgoblins kept their warlike tendencies, it being all they knew. Khans are at the top of the social food chain with Generals following after them, and so on and so forth down to the goblins and bugbears at the bottom of the food chain as slaves.

Those who are capable of fighting and that lead others into battle are respected amongst the hobgoblins, those that don't normally fight are still capable of it, able to defend themselves or attack another at a moment's notice.

Though they have Egchiin-ger  to call home, most Hobgoblins don't live there, each Khan cares for their own tribe, the group of their soldiers and their families, as they wander through the lands up north. Each tribe is tight knit many family or close friends of the Khan travel with them. Hobgoblins as a race are relatively honorable and full of comradery, with the world having hated them at the end of World’s Crux  Hobgoblins learned quickly that the only ones they could trust were each other.

Entertainment wise, The Hobgoblins entertain themselves with war games, Chess, archery competitions, Horse races, hunts, dog fights and Felconering are just some of the things that done to keep the Hobgoblins occupied in their free time.

Egchiin-ger is a simple place, FIlled with homes of those that serve the Khan of Khans along with small farmlands and the floating Palace. The Khans come here yearly to pay tribute to the Khan of Khans and to air any grievance amongst each other.

### Political
Each Tribe is ruled with absolute authority by a Khan with his closests confidentes. The Khan decides on matters of crime, being judge jury and executioner, arranging marriages amongst his tribesmen, and deciding were the tribe rides and who they fight or make allies with. The Khan is most often replaced by either a trusted advisor or one of their bloodlines when they die, but it is not unheard of for some tribes to be more democratic, having their Khan decided upon by those that they will be ruling over. Or even taken by strength of arm.

Above the Khans and every other hobgoblin they command is the Khan of Khans, or as its better known the Khagan for men or the Khatun for Women, the Khagan/Khatun is given great respect by the Khans underneath them, coming once a year to the city of Egchiin-ger to give tribute to their leader as they sit on their throne Yak Bone throne inside the Floating Palace. In times of war against other nations the Khagan will gather the Khans and their men to pour forth from the north of grey mountains to crush their foes. Those who become Khan of Khan rarely keep the position to old age. Often will a Khan filled with pride and backed by other Khans challenge the Khagan for their seat. It is a precarious balance  of keeping the respect of their underlings while also being the Iron hand that leads their people.

Khans roam across the plains with their tribes, each tribe having claim over certain regions of the Plains. Its often that Khans will become ambitious and try to take land from each other, raids on other tribes are common, but if things become one sided or out of hand Khans will  command a duel with their rival under the judgement of the Khagan. The challenged will choose the weapon and the two will fight to the death, upon victory the remaining Khan than claims the defeated lands and the two tribes are integrated into each other.

### Economy
Each tribe travels with herds of Horses and Yaks and use them to provide for themselves. Meat, cheese, and milk feed the tribes clothing is made from leather and fabric made of yak hair. Their bones and hides make the tents they sleep in and horses are given to every young hobgoblin when they come of age.

Slaves owned by the Khagan can be found mining iron from the grey mountains,  cutting wood from the small forest around the mountain, or at Egchiin-ger farming and gathering fish from one of the lakes

With as barren and spartan of a life as they tend to lead Hobgoblins mostly trade for luxuries, gold, silver, Jewels wines and other Brews are a favorite. Some Khans are collectors of weapons and will pay well for unique items to add to their collections.

### Religion
Despite their god being dead, the hobgoblin do have things the believe in. When the Hobgoblins first found the three lakes they were quick to consider them the new guardians of the Hobgoblin people, giving them names and standing:

Lo the youngest sister and the protector
The smallest of the lakes, Lo is considered the youngest of the sisters, its water is not the clearest like the sister Le or filled with fish like the sister La, Lo is the one who protects the Khagan, the Floating Palace is located on the lake, the only way to make it there is by boat or barge.

Le the middle sister and the clear 
Le is the middle lake, no fish live in it but its water bubbles up from an underground spring, making it crystal clear and an excellent source of drinking water

La the oldest sister and the provider
La is the largest lake, fish, waterfowl, and other small game live in and around it. Rice crop grow atop The outer Banks and the soil around the lake is rich with nutrition. Though the hobgoblins have kept to their nomadic life without La Egchiin-ger would not exist nor would the hobgoblins new society.

A practice that is sacred to the hobgoblins is the acquiring of a young hobgoblins first mount. When a hobgoblin is given a steed it is a permanent connection, nearly as tight as family mounts are used to the day they die, and when they do are buried with the same honor as a fallen warrior.

### Military
Hobgoblins that belong to the tribe of  Khagan are the closest to a standing military the hobgoblin have, they guard the city of Egchiin-ger and the surrounding area, watch the slaves at the lumber and mining camps, and the fortress up in the white pass.

Most hobgoblin forces are mounted, either on horses or other specialized mounts. Sabertooth tigers, and war yaks are used for certain things like stealth or sieging. If gates are in the way Ogre slaves have been trained to knock them down to open the way for the main force.

# Humans
## Farreach (Mixed, mostly human)
Nobility is mostly dead in the world of Tanrisizdir, when one has no lands left to claim and no people left to lead power tends to wane. Such was true of Farreach far in the north east, the Lebed family which had ruled the mountainous region of farreach for  centuries crumbled in the face of the apocalypse. 

Nothing was heard or any nobility through out the events of World's Crux or the centuries following the world rebuilding. Then out of nowhere a claim was made.

A young man named peter leading a band of adventures went to what was thought to be the ruins of Farreaches' old capital, Alevichi, and claimed them as his home and that his blood was that of a long lost descendent of the defunke Lebed family. 

Wasting little time the Peter and his company began to rebuild Farreach. Fortifying Alevichi and claiming the surrounding countryside along with any that lived there. And surprisingly enough few resisted, many happy at the idea of having some kind of order to their lives and protection from outside threats.

As farreach has rebuilt many have questioned if the peter's claim of being a Lebed is true. But with the effect that he has had on the region and the fact that no one alive can confirm it or any intact documents can disprove it the Lebed might be the only Noble family to keep their power, even if in name only.

### Social
Farreach is a rough and tumble place. Filled with craggy mountain ranges, thick forests and Rocky shores,  and it's people are equally rough. Those that live there are often hardened by the cold climate and a drive to survive in a harsh environment. The people in each village is expected to pull their own weight and the village as a whole is very quick to Lynch anyone or anything they consider a threat to their way of life.

That said there is some camaraderie amongst the people that live together. Weddings are celebrated by the whole community and the deceased are often mourned by many. There is very much so a feeling of looking out for your own, most times to the extreme of miss trusting outsiders.

Most people welcome Peter's rule of farreach, if for no other reason than it benefits them to have armed men defending them. Others dislike his claims of rights to a throne that no longer exists. But few have the means to be a threat to Peter and his mercenary army so petty grumbling is all they can manage.

Those that fully support Peter in his attempts to reclaim Farreach can be found in Alevichi rebuilding the city and making plans

### Political
Peter Lebedev Claims a right to the throne of farreach and its original lands as its rightful king. And while some do support him, others have no desire to be ruled, being perfectly happy with being in charge of themselves and not having to pay taxes to a man that claims to be their better.

The villages  outside of Peter's current influence tend to their little plots of land and have no real power outside their walls as mayor's run the day to day affairs.

another entity to keep in mind is the grouping of villages on the shores of raider's bay. These "sons and daughters of Tor" as they call themselves mostly busy themselves with fishing and sending out raiding parties to pillage ships and coastal villages. While currently they are to far away from Peter's base of power to be an immediate concern they will have to be dealt with either through war or diplomacy.

### Economy
The mountains are rich with silver and gold and heavy in iron. Making Farreach one of the potentially richest places in the world if that bounty was tapped into, but for now access is limited due to over ran dwarven ruins, and a lack of manpower to mine them.

Most villages fend for themselves, flocks of Hardy goats provide food and clothing, rye and other hearty grains grow in the summer months, spring is the time to collect berries and fruit for making into long lasting jams and perseveres, and tubers and squash ripen in the fall just before the blizzards roll in for the long winter.

Beers and vodka are the poison of choice in farreach though in certain places Carrots are distilled into Chucksonook, a sweeter but just as strong alternative to vodka.

### Religion
Farreach is a rugged wild place. The forests and hills are filled with all source of dark powers both Fae and monstrous. With no gods left to pray to, deals are often made with powers dark and primal. Some villages make offerings to fae beings for protection or a bountiful harvest, others ask for power or revenge against their enemies, regardless of what they ask for there is always a price to pay 

### Military
Each Village has its own town guard, young men with rust flecked weapons that have been passed down for generations, the real soldiers however are the Mercenaries that Peter has hired to help him retake Farreach.

Mercenaries of course require pay, and peter while wealthy is not a bottomless well of riches. To offset the seer amount of money needed to keep his men paid he offers more permanent long lasting payment in the form of land and titles to those who prove to be especially loyal and effective in their reclaiming of the land. This has lead to a large group of  Knights and Barons with small holdings over a village or two with a smaller more elite group of duke and earls that hold the real power right under Peter himself.

Those that become part of Peters budding kingdom are given armor and a horse befitting of a new noble, while their men are equipped with chainmail and padded gambesons and an array of weaponry, longswords, shields, crossbows, etc. after being equipped they are sent on their way to begin securing more land for the Lebe line.
