# Session Notes From The Eyes of A Halfling

## Session 1:
Mr. Lesh gave me an extra pair of his boots!...But they didn't fit. :(
He did help me obtain some scraps of fur and fabric, though. Frey helped me make some wraps for me feet so that they stay nice and warm!

We stopped in The White Pass and met some Hobgoblins! The first time ever!
Mr. Steadyhand was trading some goods with them, mostly food, silks, and luxuries. Apparently we're dealing in weapons now too!
Mr. Steadyhand took some from the hobgoblins for trade. 

I got to smell a few hobgoblins.  They're a bit odd - they smell like horse...and blood. I don't like it. 

I met a yak! His name is Eezan. He's the personal mount of The Horned Lord. He's super big and apparently they keep him pent up when people are around. 
That's not very nice of them.

There's an old man hobgoblin named Volrak who murdered a goblin that they caught stealing in the stables. Hobgoblins are meanies. They murder and feed
their goblins "servants" to their pets! How awful. 

Mr. Leshev started playing a tune and was nice enough to include the Hobgoblins! A nice young Hobgoblin decided to join as well! Her grumpy (murderous) grandpa took her away though.

The last stable holds a bunch of wolves. With one giant (winter) wolf. They're called "the ochen". They are The Blood Hound's "Ochen" (Hunter).

Kurza (the girl) is the litter-mate of the horned lord. The large winter wolf is The Hound's steed, Toolagah. 

New girl joined the caravan today. Her name is Sarah.

Learned from Lesh:
 - Cold hard land
 - Practiced a form of combat known as "Valdesteema"
 - Taste are frivilous things that aren't needed
 - His clan didn't approve of him learning anything outside of their clan

Learned from Joannes:
 - He is more comfortable around corpses than people.

 The hobgoblins surrounded us and start going through the caravan.
